# cisco-macros
This is a list of the macro's that I have pulled together and written for Cisco Room Kit Plus codecs.  They are not all 100% original, some are based foundationally off other macros and then changed to perform what I needed at the time.

I have included a couple of PDF's, including the macro scripting tutorial and codec customization guide.  I did not write nor create these documents.  These are included here for reference.
